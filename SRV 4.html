    <h2>A regular check-up.</h2>
    <p>
        As part of the Service A and Service B inspections, our experts will check your Mercedes-Benz thoroughly, change the oil and replace components in accordance with Mercedes-Benz manufacturer guidelines. While various checks are carried out as part of Service A, Service B also includes checks on all vehicle components that relate to your vehicle’s safety and ease of use. This means you can continue enjoying driving your Mercedes-Benz safely and problem-free.

    <h2>Services A and B.</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to servicing your Mercedes-Benz, trust the experts to maintain your investment in a top-notch state.


Maintenance is available from Mercedes-Benz Service in two different types: Service A and Service B. These are performed alternately at regular intervals.


Mercedes-Benz Service A* is performed at 15,000 KMs or one year, whichever comes first. Mercedes-Benz Service B* at 30,000 KMs or 2 years, whichever comes first.


Enjoy our basic service and electronic checks along with inspection points of brake system and steering & suspension.


*Services may vary depending on your vehicle’s model, year of manufacture.
Car care products are mainly used to prevent or repair damage such as paint fading, scratches, swirl marks and removing stains.

We aim to offer genuine car care products with components made of not only the finest quality, but also environment friendly and effective in usage.
When your vehicle needs maintenance or repair, use only Mercedes-Benz Genuine Parts. Designed to the highest standards of Mercedes-Benz, our genuine parts ensure your car’s performance, style, comfort and safety remain the best over a long period of time.

 

Mercedes-Benz Genuine Parts are manufactured from high-grade materials and are specifically engineered to the needs of your car.

They combine all the know-how of Mercedes-Benz as a vehicle manufacturer, are specially developed for your vehicle and optimally adapted to the other components of your vehicle.

 

Our parts will save you more in the long run as compared to the parts available in aftermarket.

Covered by the Parts Limited Warranty, so you can drive with confidence at any stage of your vehicle’s life.
Your Mercedes-Benz service partner protects you from counterfeit products. This is because, unfortunately, where it says Mercedes-Benz on the outside, it doesn't always say Mercedes-Benz on the inside. Counterfeiters are increasingly specialising in copying vehicle replacement parts. Safety-relevant parts such as brake discs and pads, windscreen wipers, windscreens, chassis parts or filters are increasingly being copied. Counterfeit parts often appear deceptively genuine, to the point that not even experts can easily identify them at first glance.
